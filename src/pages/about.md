As a Ph.D. candidate of bioinformatics and full-stack developer,
I am currently building advertisement systems (Sklik) and machine learning models while
coding for Seznam a.s. and studying at Brno University of Technology.
Outside of coding, I can be found gravel riding or running.

## Tech Stack

My primary focus in the tech stack is on web development and TypeScript. I am also interested
in system architecture of large systems.

```typescript
type FullStack = Frontend & Backend;

const patrik: FullStack = {
  currentlyUse: ["Typescript", "NodeJs", "Python"],
  askMeAbout: ["web development", "machine learning"],
  focus: ["Web development", "System architecture", "Machine learning"],
  technologies: {
    frontend: ["ReactJS", "Typescript"],
    backend: {
      js: ["NextJS", "Express"],
      python: ["Flask", "fastapi"],
    },
    devOps: [
      "Kubernetes",
      "Dockerüê≥",
      "Gitlab CI/CD",
      "Github actions",
      "ArgoCD",
    ],
    databases: ["mongo", "Maria db", "sqlite", "redis"],
    machineLearning: ["Keras", "XGBoost", "scikit-learn", "opencv"],
  },
  architecture: ["Microservice", "Single page applications"],
};
```
